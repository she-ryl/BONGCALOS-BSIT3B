The system I made was an e-commerce that the user can add,update,
and delete record. When you go to the system the first step that you 
can see was the login form wherein you can create an new account and if you
have already an account you can click the sign in button. If you are the admin you can manage
the accounts wherein you can add,update and delete an account same us with the products.
When you login as a user you can view products.
